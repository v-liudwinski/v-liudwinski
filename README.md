# I'm a Backend .NET Developer ðŸ’»
I have always been interested in creating something new and
progressive, something that will do good. And when I discovered the
world of software development, I knew that this was exactly what I
wanted to do. That is why I have an unstoppable desire to consolidate
existing skills, learn new ones and grow as a specialist.
